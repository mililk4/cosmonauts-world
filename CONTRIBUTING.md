## Notes 

`tendermint core`*: refers to the implementation, the engine. <br />
`tendermint bft`: refers to the concept, possibly the spec but not specifically the reference implementation.

[*] Tendermint Core is currently what's ecosystem compatible, meaning Tendermint Core chains can interoperate with other chains within Cosmos Network.
