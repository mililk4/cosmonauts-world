Cosmos & Tendermint Ecosystem

Built with `Next.js` + `Tailwind CSS` + `Framer Motion API` + `Feather icons`

Live site: https://cosmonauts.world

ðŸ“£: This is an experimental project by [@lovincyrus](https://github.com/lovincyrus), and it is not a Cosmos organization project.

## Motivation

This project aims to answer questions as such,

1. How many projects are in the Cosmos and Tendermint Ecosystem? (https://github.com/lovincyrus/cosmonauts-world/blob/master/components/companies.jsx#L111)
2. Which projects are using which technology? (https://github.com/lovincyrus/cosmonauts-world/issues/1)

This repository will be the singular source of truth for the Cosmos & Tendermint projects. Therefore, this repository should be considered as a living document which will be maintained by the community. This repository is not limited to the ecosystem listed on [Cosmos Network - Ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem). So long as you're using Cosmos / Tendermint, you can add your project to the `JSON` [file](/data/posts.json). ðŸŒŒ
